;; Flymake is a minor Emacs mode performing on-the-fly syntax checks.

;; This file contains the UI for displaying and interacting with the

PROPS is an alist of properties that are applied, in order, to
the diagnostics of each type.  The recognized properties are:

* Every property pertaining to overlays, except `category' and
  `evaporate' (see Info Node `(elisp)Overlay Properties'), used
  affect the appearance of Flymake annotations.

* `bitmap', an image displayed in the fringe according to
  `flymake-fringe-indicator-position'.  The value actually
  follows the syntax of `flymake-error-bitmap' (which see).  It
  is overriden by any `before-string' overlay property.

* `severity', a non-negative integer specifying the diagnostic's
  severity.  The higher, the more serious.  If the overlay
  priority `priority' is not specified, `severity' is used to set
  it and help sort overlapping overlays.

* `flymake-category', a symbol whose property list is considered
  as a default for missing values of any other properties.  This
  is useful to backend authors when creating new diagnostic types
  that differ from an existing type by only a few properties.")
